I am a PhD student at Northeastern's Khoury College of Computer Science in [Olga Vitek's lab](https://olga-vitek-lab.khoury.northeastern.edu/), focusing on computational methods for mass-spectrometry based proteomics. My goal during my PhD is to develop computational methods and open source software to speed up and reduce costs for large scale proteomics experiments, while maintaining the highest standards of reproducibility.
